* Bridge and Torch Problem
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can
only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's night, the
torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. Person A can cross the bridge in
1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. When two people
cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question
is, can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?

/NOTE: The parameters used for the assignment were different./

Written in Python 3.8 as an assignment for an AI course. It compares the suitability
and performance of the following algorithms: Breadth-first search, Best-first search
(using a heurestic), A* search and Iterative deepening search.

** Language
The program's output and the report pdf are in Greek. If a translation is needed
please open an Issue.

** Documentation
~report.pdf~ is the report submitted with the code and contains documentation of the
program, its structure and the heurestics used.

** Screenshots
After running the program ~python3 main.py~ the user is asked to insert the problem
data: number of people, the time each person needs to cross the bridge.

After a result is calculated it is displayed along with information about the
algorithm's performace.

In the image below, we see the output of the A* search algorithm.

A* search algorithm:
P1 and P2 cross the bridge in 2 minutes.
P1 returns in 1 minute.
P3 and P4 cross the bridge in 10 minutes.
P2 returns in 2 minutes.
P1 and P2 cross the bridge in 2 minutes.
